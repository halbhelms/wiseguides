          We get it. You're trying to run your family business. But rivals get in the way. And it's not like the old days when you
          could call a meeting of the Five Families and then ambush them. People have already seen
          <em>The Godfather</em>.</p>

        <p>We got a solution: Wise Guides pizza delivery. You call us. We show up at their place. Hey &mdash; who's gonna refuse
          pizza? Only this pizza comes
          <em>with a side of red sauce...</em>

        <p>Yeah, sure. We get that. But hey, you're gonna send your clean-up crew. They're gonna get hungry. Who says you can't
          kill two birds with one stone, so to speak?
